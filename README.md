# Reinforcement-Learning-on-CartPole game-Q-vs-DQN
This repository contains AI project for Cartpole balancing game by using Q-Learning algorithm and Deep Q-network learning algorithm. 

In this semester project I implemented two AI agents to play CartPole game using Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning. I then carry out comparative study and analysis of these two methods and draw conclusion based on that.
